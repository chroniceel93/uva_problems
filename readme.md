# Programming Challenge Solutions

This is a collection of completed and in-progress programming challenge solutions as seen on onlinejudge.com.

I solved many of these over the course of 14 weeks as an exercise for a Programming Challenges class. These solutions are not all optimal, and some of them are simply non-functional. I plan to re-work all incomplete or incorrect solutions in my spare time. I will also attempt to comment my solutions as best I can for readability. Eventually I wish to re-write all correct solutions in Java, Python and Pascal for no other reason than because the onlinejudge in question will accept solutions in those languages. I decided in the end to avoid providing the complete set of test cases I used- Many of them were provided by the helful folks over at UVA Debug. Where possible, though, I'll supply any code I used to generate my own test cases.

Further, I ended up developing a fairly rudimentary script to automatically build and test my solutions- And a script to clean the project directory of all extreneous files. These scripts are included, of course.

I do not endorse the use of the code here for the purposes of academic dishonesty. *Please* don't mess with that. It's not worth it, and will stick with you for the rest of your career.
